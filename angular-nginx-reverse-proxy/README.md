## Setup
Instead of enabling CORS on the browser, nginx is used as reverse proxy. 
- web browser is talking to single server without knowing that UI and REST services are running on separate servers.
- CORS is not necessary
- nginx configuration is [here](default) 
- nginx is routing http traffic to angular UI and/or REST server

sudo systemctl start nginx 
sudo systemctl stop nginx 
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```
config: ``/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default``
